# 📊 Credit Score Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer financial data to understand the key factors influencing Credit Score classification (Good, Standard, Poor).  
The goal is to identify financial and behavioral patterns that impact creditworthiness and derive actionable business insights for better credit risk management.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Financial institutions must accurately assess customer credit risk to reduce defaults and improve portfolio quality. Poor credit evaluation can lead to financial losses, while overly strict policies can reduce customer acquisition.  
This project analyzes customer data to uncover patterns that influence credit score categories and highlight risk-driving factors.

## 🏢 Business Objective
- Identify characteristics of high-risk customers  
- Understand factors impacting credit score classification  
- Support data-driven credit approval strategies  
- Detect early warning indicators of financial stress  
- Lay foundation for predictive credit scoring models  

## 📂 Dataset Information
Includes Age, Occupation, Annual Income, Monthly Salary, Outstanding Debt, Credit Utilization Ratio, Loans, Delayed Payments, Credit Mix, EMI, Credit Inquiries, Payment Behaviour, and Credit Score (Target Variable).

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Univariate**: Credit Score distribution, Income, Debt, Utilization, Loans, Occupation, Credit Mix  
- **Bivariate**: Income vs Credit Score, Debt vs Credit Score, Utilization vs Credit Score, etc.  
- **Multivariate**: Correlation Heatmap, Debt & Utilization Impact, Income & EMI Interaction  

## 📈 Key Insights
- High Outstanding Debt strongly correlates with Poor credit scores  
- High Credit Utilization Ratio is a major risk indicator  
- Frequent delayed payments significantly reduce credit score  
- Balanced credit mix improves credit stability  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab 
3. Upload the dataset (`paisabazaar.csv`)  
4. Run all cells from top to bottom

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Develop Machine Learning model for credit score prediction  
- Perform feature engineering for improved accuracy  
- Deploy risk scoring dashboard using Power BI or Streamlit

## 📌 Conclusion
- Customers with high debt and utilization ratios are most at risk.  
- Delayed payments and minimum-only payments are strong red flags.  
- Balanced credit mix improves portfolio stability.  

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Strengthen monitoring of customers with high utilization and debt.  
- Offer financial literacy programs to reduce delayed payments.  
- Incentivize balanced credit mix through product offerings.  
- Use predictive modeling to flag risk early and improve approvals.
